# badrobots

A directory of terribly implemented and insecure IoT hardware; a crowdsourced hall of shame explaining what not to do when building your next IoT product.

## Contributing

Create data for a new product, following the instructions found in `templates.txt` then append it to the `products` array in `data/index.json`.

## Guidelines

  - This is not an exploit database. Do not include links to exploits.
  - Do not include issues if they are part of a product's advertised functionality, unless the very existence of said functionality is itself grossly stupid.
